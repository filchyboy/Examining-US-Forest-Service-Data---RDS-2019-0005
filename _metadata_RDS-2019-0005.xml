      <abstract>This data publication contains field and satellite observations at 1567 plots across wildfire extents that burned between the years 2000-2007, collected for Joint Fire Science Project ID: 14-1-02-27. Field attributes were measured between the years 2013-2016 and include a suite of vegetation, soil, and surface cover characteristics. Satellite observations include differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) measurements from Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), as well as annual (1984-2016) satellite observations of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from the Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm. Previously burned areas included the extents of the 2000 Jasper wildfire in western South Dakota; 2002 Hayman wildfire in central Colorado; 2003 Black Mountain, Cooney Ridge, Robert, and Wedge Canyon wildfires in western Montana; 2003 Old and Simi wildfires in southern California; 2003 Myrtle Creek wildfire in northern Idaho; 2004 Porcupine, Chicken, and Wall Street wildfires in interior Alaska; 2005 School wildfire in eastern Washington; 2005 Ricco wildfire in South Dakota; 2006 Shake Table or Thorn Creek wildfire in central Oregon; 2006 Tripod wildfire complex in north-central Washington; 2007 Egley wildfire in central Oregon; and the 2007 East Zone/Cascade wildfire complex in central Idaho. Field attributes had been measured previously at many of these locations; Hudak (2010) contains previous field attribute data for some of the Montana, California, and Alaska plots; and Hudak (2013) contains previous field attribute data for some of the Idaho plots. Bright et al. (2019, IN PREPARATION) contains previous field attribute data for most of the Oregon plots.</abstract>
      <purpose>The objective was to assess long-term post-fire vegetation recovery and fuels with field observations and satellite remote sensing.</purpose>
      <supplinf>R code is also provided to merge these data with Hudak (2010, 2013) and Bright et al. (2019).</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Field observations were gathered by various trained field personnel. Data have been used in several analyses that revealed some inaccuracies, which have been corrected in this data publication. Likewise, extracted satellite data have been reviewed for possible errors. Plot locations were acquired using resource-grade GNSS receivers that logged a minimum of 150 points; estimated location accuracies are given in meters in ‘VERT_PREC’ and ‘HORZ_PREC’ attributes.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>The field data were transferred from hard copy to digital format by two separate data entry persons, so that discrepancies could be flagged and compared to the original data. Spreadsheet functions were used to check the data for logical errors at the time of recording.</logic>
    <complete>If missing data could not be deduced from plot photos or other recorded field observations, they were given ‘NA’ values. Vertical and horizontal position accuracies were unavailable at some plots. ‘NA’ values were also assigned when data were not recorded: Tall shrub cover and 1000-hour fuels were only recorded at ‘A’ subplots, and were not recorded at all plots. Fuel variables and tree variables (including overstory, saplings, and seedling variables) were not recorded at many plots. Landsat time series data were not produced for Alaska. Site 1 in Wedge Canyon, Montana, was previously measured in 2002, but not was measured in 2013 with the rest of the Wedge Canyon sites. Atypical plots include a ‘G’ plot at Cooney Ridge Site 3 in Montana, which was an additional pre-fire fuel plot, and Porcupine Site 3 in Alaska, which was a single plot in close proximity to Site 2.</complete>

      <method>
        <methdesc>SAMPLING DESIGN:

There were eight states where wildfires were sampled, listed chronologically in the order of sampling, with burn year shown in parentheses.

2013-15: Montana (2003): Black Mountain 2, Cooney Ridge, Robert and Wedge Canyon
2015: California (2003): Simi, Old/Grand Prix
2015: Colorado (2002): Hayman
2015: South Dakota (2000): Jasper
2015: Washington (2005): School
2016: Oregon (2007): Egley
2016: Idaho (2007): Cascade, East Zone
2016: Alaska (2004): Porcupine, Chicken, Wall Street
		
Field site selection was based on a stratified random sampling design based on elevation, aspect (transformed), and one-year post-fire dNBR burn severity as classified by MTBS. As proposed, we conducted each stratification by vegetation type within a specific geographic locale, and not necessarily by each individual wildfire. In other words, two wildfires burning in close proximity within the same vegetation type were treated (in terms of sampling) as a single wildfire event. We exploited the opportunity to re-measure old field sites established in past rapid response research projects, provided we could safely access them. Old field sites partially populated our landscape stratifications; to fully populate the strata, new field sites were subsequently added at random locations yet close enough to navigable roads to permit practical access. In the summer 2015 field season, we began adding unburned sites to our stratification and sampling.

		
FIELD ATTRIBUTES:

Understory cover variables and richness, as well as 1-, 10-, and 100-hour fuels were recorded in square, 1-square meter (m2) plots. 1000-hr fuels were estimated within circular 1/50th hectare (ha) fixed-radius plots. On ‘A’ subplots, tree basal area was measured for trees with diameter at breast heights (DBH, 1.37 meters [m]) of  ≥ 10 centimeters (cm) on circular 1/50th ha fixed-radius plots; on all other subplots (B, D, F, H), tree basal area was measured on variable radius plots using a prism with a basal area factor of two m2 per ha. Seedling and sampling counts, later converted to seedling densities, were taken on one to four quadrants of circular 1/100th ha plots in most cases, except on many Montana plots, where counts were done on variable-area belt transects. Saplings were defined as being taller than DBH with DBH measurements of &lt; 10 cm; trees &gt; DBH in height were considered seedlings. See the associated field sampling protocol document (\Supplements\BurnSev_remeas_field_sampling_protocol_v7.pdf; included in the full data publication download) for more details.

SATELLITE DATA: 

Annual NBR data were derived from the LandTrendr spectral-temporal algorithm (Kennedy et al. 2010), implemented in Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al. 2017, Kennedy et al. 2018). LandTrendr identifies and fits straight-line segments, pixel by pixel, to stacks of Landsat surface reflectance images, so that low-level noise in pixel time series is reduced and trends are more apparent. For this project NBR was used for segmentation and fitting. For more LandTrendr processing details, see Bright et al. (IN PRESS). Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (DNBR) values, indicators of burn severity, were extracted from DNBR rasters produced by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program (Eidenshink et al. 2007).

DATA FILES
		  
\Data\field_attrib_and_satellite_data.csv: Comma-delimited ASCII text file containing field attributes such as vegetation, soil, and surface cover characteristics measured from 2013-2016 for five western U.S. ecosystems that had fires from 2000-2007. Also included are satellite observations such as differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) measurements from Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), as well as annual (1984-2016) satellite observations of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from the Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm. (For a list and description of each variable in this file see \Data\field_attrib_and_satellite_descriptions.csv.)
